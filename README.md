    2. Implementation of Low-Power Adaptive Protocol for Direct Terminal. Analysis of memory hierarchy – introduction of power control meta-parameters and parameters. Main program and required additional modules tools. Power (current analysis) for Direct Terminal.
### Part 2 (optional)
    1. Presentation of Close Terminal (MAC-WiFi) and MAC-WiFi Router with simple communication to ThingSpeak server. 
    2. Implementation of Low-Power Adaptive Protocol for Close Terminal. Main program and required additional modules tools. Power (current analysis) for Close Terminal.
### Part 3
    1. Presentation of Remote Terminal (MAC-WiFi) and LoRa-WiFi Gateway with simple communication to ThingSpeak server. 
    2. Implementation of Low-Power Adaptive Protocol for Remote Terminal. AES protection and ACK packets. Main program and required additional modules tools. Power (current analysis) for Remote Terminal.

## Attention:
**All examples coded in µPython are prepared on RISC-V and x86 SBCs.** The hands-on part deals only with the preparation/modification of the parameters and running the prepared examples.
